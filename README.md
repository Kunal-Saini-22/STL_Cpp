# STL C++

### 1.Array
>Stores the elements of the same datatype in contiguous memory locations.while declaring an array we need to give it some fixed size.<br>

### 2.Vector
> It's a dynamic size array i.e user need not to pre-define its size as we keep pushing the elements into it its size & capacity changes by itself.<br>

### 3.Set
> Stores unique elements in sorted manner.
   **Note** : set is internally implemented using RB tree therefore (any address) can’t be subjected to arithmetic operators like ‘address + 1’
   or ‘address -1’ instead of it ‘address++’ or ‘address - -’ operators should be used.<br>

### 4. Multiset 
 > Stores values in sorted order but not uniquely.<br>

### 5. Unordered_Set
 > A set that stores value in a random order. As it's a type of set that's why it stores only unique values.<br>
