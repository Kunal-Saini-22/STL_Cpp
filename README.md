# STL C++

### 1.Array
>Stores the elements of the same datatype in contiguous memory locations.while declaring an array we need to give it some fixed size.<br>
   [Arrays in C++ STL](https://www.studytonight.com/cpp/stl/stl-container-array)
### 2.Vector
> It's a dynamic array.<br>
 [Vectors in C++ STL](https://takeuforward.org/c/vector-in-c-stl/)

### 3.Set
> Stores unique elements in sorted manner.
   **Note** : set is internally implemented using RB tree therefore (any address) can’t be subjected to arithmetic operators like ‘address + 1’
   or ‘address -1’ instead of     ‘address’ or ‘address - -’ operators should be used.<br>

### 4. Multiset 
 > Stores values in sorted order but not uniquely.<br>
